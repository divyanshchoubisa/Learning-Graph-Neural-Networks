Many works in the GNN literature ([Hamilton et al. (2017)](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/graphsage-nips17.pdf), [Xu et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826), [Corso et al. (2020)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/99cad265a1768cc2dd013f0e740300ae-Paper.pdf), [Li et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07739)), demonstrate that the choice of aggregation functions contributes significantly to the performance of GNN models. In particular, the performance of GNNs with different aggregation functions differs when applied to distinct tasks and datasets. Recent works also show that using multiple aggregations ([Corso et al. (2020)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/99cad265a1768cc2dd013f0e740300ae-Paper.pdf)) and learnable aggregations ([Li et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07739)) can potentially gain substantial improvements. To facilitate experimentation with these different aggregation schemes and unify concepts of aggregation within GNNs across both [`MessagePassing`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/torch_geometric/nn/conv/message_passing.py) and [global readouts](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/torch_geometric/nn/glob), we provide **modular and re-usable aggregations** in the newly defined `torch_geometric.nn.aggr.*` package.

Now let's see how can we define multiple aggregations with [MultiAggregation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.aggr.MultiAggregation). Here we use different initial temperatures for [SoftmaxAggregation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.aggr.SoftmaxAggregation) ([Li et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07739)).

This new abstraction also makes designing new types of aggregation functions easier. Now, you can create your own aggregation function with the base `Aggregation` class.
